//! # Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) Implementation
//! 
//! This module provides Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) functionality for
//! RTP packet loss detection and recovery. NACK allows receivers to request
//! retransmission of lost packets, improving media quality and reliability.
//! 
//! ## Key Features
//! 
//! - **Packet Loss Detection**: Detect missing RTP packets by sequence number
//! - **NACK Generation**: Generate NACK messages for lost packets
//! - **Retransmission Requests**: Request retransmission of lost packets
//! - **Sequence Tracking**: Track received packet sequence numbers
//! - **Loss Recovery**: Improve media quality through packet recovery
//! 
//! ## NACK Process
//! 
//! 1. **Packet Reception**: Track received packet sequence numbers
//! 2. **Loss Detection**: Identify missing sequence numbers
//! 3. **NACK Generation**: Create NACK messages for lost packets
//! 4. **Retransmission**: Request sender to retransmit lost packets
//! 5. **Recovery**: Receive and process retransmitted packets
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! ```rust
//! use nebula_media::nack::NackSender;
//! use std::time::Instant;
//! 
//! // Create NACK sender
//! let mut nack_sender = NackSender::new(1000);
//! 
//! // Track received packets; gaps become candidates for NACK
//! nack_sender.remember_received(100);
//! nack_sender.remember_received(103); // 101,102 will be marked missing
//! 
//! // Ask which sequence numbers we should NACK right now (rate-limited)
//! if let Some(to_nack) = nack_sender.send_nacks(Instant::now()) {
//!     for seq in to_nack { /* send NACK for seq */ }
//! }
//! ```
