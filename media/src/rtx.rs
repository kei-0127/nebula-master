//! # RTP Retransmission (RTX)
//!
//! This module implements RTP retransmission (RTX) functionality for reliable media delivery.
//! RTX allows the sender to retransmit lost RTP packets by wrapping them in RTX packets
//! with a different SSRC and sequence number.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Packet Caching**: Maintains a cache of recently sent packets for retransmission
//! - **RTX Packet Generation**: Creates RTX packets from cached original packets
//! - **Sequence Number Management**: Manages RTX sequence numbers per SSRC
//! - **Automatic Cleanup**: Automatically removes old packets from cache
//!
//! ## RTX Protocol
//!
//! RTX packets follow RFC 4588:
//! 1. **Different SSRC**: RTX packets use a different SSRC than original packets
//! 2. **Original Sequence**: Original sequence number is embedded in payload
//! 3. **New Sequence**: RTX packets get new sequence numbers
//! 4. **Payload Wrapping**: Original payload is wrapped with sequence number
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use nebula_media::rtx::RtxSender;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Create RTX sender with 30-second cache
//! let mut rtx_sender = RtxSender::new(Duration::from_secs(30));
//!
//! // Remember sent packet
//! rtx_sender.remember_sent(packet_data, Instant::now());
//!
//! // Retransmit packet
//! if let Some(rtx_packet) = rtx_sender.resend_as_rtx(ssrc, seqnum) {
//!     send_packet(rtx_packet);
//! }
//! ```
